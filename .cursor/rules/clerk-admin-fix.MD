# Fixing Clerk Admin Role Access in Convex React Apps

This document details a common issue encountered when implementing role-based access control (RBAC) with Clerk and Convex, specifically for admin-only sections, and the solution applied to resolve it.

## The Problem: Premature Data Fetching and "No Identity" Errors

When building an admin dashboard or admin-specific sections in a React application using Convex for the backend and Clerk for authentication, a frequent issue is that frontend components attempt to fetch data _before_ the Convex client has fully synchronized the authentication state from Clerk.

Admin-only Convex queries and mutations are typically protected by a helper function (e.g., `requireAdminRole`) that:

1.  Calls `await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` to get the authenticated user's details.
2.  Checks for the presence of an admin role (e.g., `identity.role === "admin"`) derived from Clerk's JWT (often via custom claims like `{"role": "{{user.public_metadata.role}}"}`).

The problem arises because:

- React components might render and trigger `useQuery` or `usePaginatedQuery` hooks immediately on load.
- At this initial moment, `useConvexAuth()` might still have `isLoading` as true, or `isAuthenticated` as false, because the Clerk session is still being verified and propagated to the Convex client.
- If a Convex query that calls `requireAdminRole` is executed during this transitional state, `await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` inside the Convex function can return `null`.
- This leads to `requireAdminRole` throwing an error like "Authentication required for admin action" or "No identity found," even if the user _is_ logged in and _does_ have the admin role. The frontend component simply tried to fetch data too early.

Essentially, it's a timing issue where the frontend doesn't wait for the authentication status to be definitively established before making protected calls.

## The Solution: Auth-Aware Frontend Components with Conditional Query Skipping

The solution is to make the frontend components that fetch admin-protected data "authentication-aware." This involves using the `useConvexAuth` hook from `convex/react` to manage UI and data fetching based on the current authentication state.

The key steps implemented in each relevant admin React component are:

1.  **Import and Use `useConvexAuth`**:

```
import { useConvexAuth } from "convex/react";
// ...
const { isLoading: authIsLoading, isAuthenticated } = useConvexAuth();
```

2.  **Handle Authentication Loading State**:
    Display a loading message or placeholder if the authentication state is still being determined. This prevents the component from trying to render its main content or fetch data prematurely.

```
if (authIsLoading) {
  return <div>Loading authentication...</div>;
}
```

3.  **Conditionally Skip Queries**:
    Modify `useQuery` or `usePaginatedQuery` calls to pass `"skip"` as the argument if authentication is still loading OR if the user is not authenticated. The query will only proceed with its actual arguments if `authIsLoading` is `false` AND `isAuthenticated` is `true`.

```
// Example for a query with arguments:
const queryArgs = { someFilter: "value" }; // Your actual query arguments
const data = useQuery(
  api.myModule.myAdminQuery,
  authIsLoading || !isAuthenticated ? "skip" : queryArgs
);

// Example for a query with no arguments:
const dataNoArgs = useQuery(
  api.myModule.myAdminQueryNoArgs,
  authIsLoading || !isAuthenticated ? "skip" : {}
);
```

4.  **Handle "Not Authenticated" State (Optional but Recommended)**:
    After the `authIsLoading` check, if `!isAuthenticated`, you can display a "Please log in" message. This is especially useful if routing doesn't strictly prevent unauthenticated users from reaching the component's path.

```
if (!isAuthenticated) {
  return <div>Please log in to access this section.</div>;
}
```

5.  **Backend Still Verifies**:
    It's crucial to understand that this frontend change primarily addresses the timing issue of _when_ the query is made. The actual enforcement of the admin role still happens on the backend within the `requireAdminRole` function. If an authenticated non-admin user somehow bypasses client-side UI restrictions (or if the query is public but the _action_ it implies is admin-only), `requireAdminRole` will correctly throw an error, protecting your data.

### Generic component example

```
import React from "react";
import { useQuery, useConvexAuth } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../../../convex/_generated/api"; // Adjust path

export function AdminSectionComponent() {
  const { isLoading: authIsLoading, isAuthenticated } = useConvexAuth();

  // Define your query arguments, if any
  const queryArgs = {
    /* your arguments */
  };

  const adminData = useQuery(
    api.admin.getSensitiveData, // Your admin-protected query
    authIsLoading || !isAuthenticated ? "skip" : queryArgs
  );

  if (authIsLoading) {
    return <div className="text-center py-10">Loading authentication...</div>;
  }

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    // This message is shown if auth is resolved and user is not logged in.
    // Your main router should ideally handle redirecting unauthenticated users from admin routes.
    return <div className="text-center py-10">Please log in to access admin features.</div>;
  }

  // At this point, isAuthenticated is true.
  // If adminData is undefined, the query might still be loading (status === "LoadingFirstPage")
  // or was skipped (if somehow this point is reached with isAuthenticated false - less likely with above check).

  if (adminData === undefined && isAuthenticated) {
    // Query is loading its first page
    return <div className="text-center py-10">Loading admin data...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Admin Data</h2>
      {/* Render your adminData here */}
      {/* Example: <pre>{JSON.stringify(adminData, null, 2)}</pre> */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Quick-start checklist for Clerk + Convex admin

1. Client wiring

```
// src/main.tsx
import { ConvexReactClient } from "convex/react";
import { ConvexProviderWithClerk } from "convex/react-clerk";
import { ClerkProvider, useAuth } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL as string);

<ClerkProvider publishableKey={import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY as string}>
  <ConvexProviderWithClerk client={convex} useAuth={useAuth}>
    <App />
  </ConvexProviderWithClerk>
</ClerkProvider>
```

2. Convex auth config

```
// convex/auth.config.js
export default {
  providers: [
    { domain: process.env.CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN, applicationID: "convex" },
  ],
};
```

Set the env on your dev deployment:

```
npx convex env set CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN https://<your-subdomain>.clerk.accounts.dev
```

3. Role in Clerk

- Set `public_metadata.role` to `"admin"` for your admin user in the Clerk dashboard.
- Optionally configure a JWT template to include that claim; Convex reads it via `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`.

4. Backend guard

```
// convex/functions.ts
async function requireAdminRole(ctx) {
  const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
  if (!identity) throw new Error("Authentication required for admin action");
  const role = identity.publicMetadata?.role || identity.role;
  if (role !== "admin") throw new Error("Admin role required");
}
```

5. Frontend guard pattern

```
import { useConvexAuth } from "convex/react";

const { isLoading: convexAuthLoading, isAuthenticated } = useConvexAuth();
const data = useQuery(api.functions.listAllEventsForAdmin,
  convexAuthLoading || !isAuthenticated ? "skip" : {}
);
```

## Common pitfalls

- Missing `ConvexProviderWithClerk` wrapper – useConvexAuth will throw.
- Two copies of `convex/react` loaded (e.g., multiple apps in a multi-project repo) – ensure a single instance.
- Not setting `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` in Convex env – backend identity is always null.
- Triggering admin queries before auth sync – always conditionally pass `"skip"`.
- Admin role not present in Clerk user metadata – `requireAdminRole` will fail.

## Key Takeaways

- **Frontend Must Wait**: Frontend components must wait for Clerk authentication to be fully resolved by the Convex client before attempting to fetch data from protected Convex queries.
- **`useConvexAuth` is Key**: This hook provides the necessary `authIsLoading` and `isAuthenticated` states.
- **Conditional Query Skipping**: Using the `"skip"` option in `useQuery` / `usePaginatedQuery` based on these auth states is the primary mechanism to prevent premature calls.
- **Layered Security**: Frontend checks improve UX and reduce unnecessary backend calls. Backend functions (`requireAdminRole`) provide the actual security enforcement.

By implementing this pattern across all admin-facing components that fetch data, the "No identity found" errors related to auth timing are resolved, and the admin sections become robust and load data correctly based on the user's authentication and authorization status.

## Cursor Rule: `convex-clerk-admin-auth-guard`

This rule helps ensure that React components using Convex queries with Clerk authentication correctly handle loading and authentication states before attempting to fetch data, especially for admin-protected queries.

  }
  return false;
advice: |
  When using Convex queries that require admin authentication (often named like `...Admin`) with Clerk, ensure your React component correctly handles authentication states to prevent errors:

  1.  **Use `useConvexAuth`**: Get `authIsLoading` and `isAuthenticated`.
      ```
      import { useConvexAuth } from "convex/react";
      // ...
      const { isLoading: authIsLoading, isAuthenticated } = useConvexAuth();
      ```

  2.  **Handle Auth Loading**: Display a loading message if `authIsLoading` is true.
      ```
      if (authIsLoading) {
        return <div>Loading authentication...</div>;
      }
      ```

  3.  **Handle Not Authenticated**: (Optional, but good for UX if routing doesn't cover it)
      If not `authIsLoading` and not `isAuthenticated`, prompt for login.
      ```
      if (!isAuthenticated) {
        return <div>Please log in to access this section.</div>;
      }
      ```

  4.  **Conditionally Skip Queries**: Pass `"skip"` to `useQuery` or `usePaginatedQuery` if `authIsLoading` or `!isAuthenticated`.
      ```
      const adminData = useQuery(
        api.yourModule.yourAdminQuery,
        (authIsLoading || !isAuthenticated) ? "skip" : { /* your_args */ }
      );
      ```
  This prevents queries from running before authentication is resolved, avoiding "No identity found" errors from `requireAdminRole` in your Convex functions.
